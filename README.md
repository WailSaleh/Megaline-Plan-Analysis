# Megaline-Plan-Analysis 🌐📱

An analysis will be conducted for the telecommunications company Megaline, which offers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. A preliminary examination will be carried out using a sample of 500 customers. Data will include information on who the customers are, their locations, the plan they use, and the number of calls and messages made in 2018.

Here is a breakdown of the plans:

**Surf**

Monthly price: $20

500 minutes per month, 50 text messages, and 15 GB of data

After exceeding the packet limits:

1 minute: 3 centavos

1 text message: 3 cents

1 GB of data: $10

**Ultimate**

Monthly price: $70

3,000 monthly minutes, 1,000 text messages, and 30 GB of data

After exceeding the packet limits:

1 minute: 1 centavo

1 text message: 1 cent

1 GB of data: $7

The goal is to determine which plan generates more revenue to help adjust the advertising budget effectively.

The analysis process is as following:

1- Organize and clean the data in order to have a clear analysis.

2- Analyze the usage patterns of customers on both plans, including the number of calls, minutes, messages, and internet usage.

3- Calculate and compare the revenue generated by each plan based on its pricing structure.

4- Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis to determine which plan is more profitable for Megaline.
